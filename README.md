# SkilloProject

This is my final project for proving what I have learnt during the automation course. The project is on one main package called Projets. This package is spiltted into 2 sub-packages - Pages and Tests. In Pages packages could be found all used web pages (as their elements, methods, variables, etc), based on the Page Object Model. As it's self-explanatory, the Tests pagage contains all crated tests.  The scope of the project is ISkillo web site.  It contains 5 test cases, which will cover:
- Loginng
- Creating a post
- Writing of a comment
- Editing of a user
- Searching for a user

There are two options tests to be executed. First one is by the IDE. The second one is by Maven command. To execute the tests by second option, you must run the testngTest.xml file. The file could be found into resources package. 

Used frameworks:
- TestNG;
- Selenium;
- Maven;
